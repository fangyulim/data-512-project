# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the impact of wildfires on Wichita, Kansas. This project begins with an analysis of the wildfire smoke produced by fires in the region and its potential health impacts on local citizens. By analyzing these effects, the objective is to inform policymakers and government bodies about the need to consider or implement strategies to mitigate future impacts from wildfires, particularly on public health.
            
The primary focus of the analysis is on the health consequences of wildfire smoke exposure, particularly on respiratory health and lung cancer. Specifically, this project investigates two key health outcomes:       
1. Asthma-related hospitalization rates at the county level.
2. Cancer rates in the respiratory system, with an emphasis on lung and bronchial cancers.
                     
Key findings:
1. Asthma-related Hospitalization: Between 2008 and 2018, asthma hospitalization rates increased and were moderately correlated with wildfire smoke. This suggests that wildfire smoke exacerbates respiratory conditions like asthma, leading to more hospitalizations during high-smoke events. The intensity of the impact however was not investigated.
2. Cancer Rates: Cancer rates in Kansas did not show a consistent upward trend. While there were fluctuations, the overall cancer trend was relatively stable. However, a surprising negative correlation was found between Larynx cancer and wildfire smoke. This was unexpected, but one possible explanation is that preventative actions due to increased public awareness could lower cancer risks. Alternatively, there are other confounding factors such as smoking behavior that might influence the results. 
            
You can find more information about my findings in the [final_report](reports/final_report.docx).

# Data Sets
- [Combined Wildland Fire Datasets ](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81)    
  - This cleaned wildfire dataset was generated by the US Geological Survey. This project uses the GeoJSON data format stored under GeoJSON Files.zip. It contains a raw merged datasets containing duplicated, and a combined dataset that is free of duplicates. This project uses the combined data which contains information on fires (wildfires and prescribed) from 1961 to 2020. For this project we filter for data that is between 1961 and 2024, and only preserve 4 attributes (Fire_Year, Listed_Fire_Names, GIS_Acres, Assigned_Fire_Type) and save it to a [csv file](./intermediate_data/wildfire.csv)
  - Description: 
    The inital datset is a JSON dictionary containing the following fields:     
    ['displayFieldName', 'fieldAliases', 'geometryType', 'spatialReference', 'fields', 'features']    
    We are mainly interested in the 'features' key which is another dictionary.

The terms of use can be found under the **Request Limits and Terms of Service** in the documentation.

- [part1_AQI_index.ipynb](./modules/part1_AQI_index.ipynb): This jupyter notebook provides details on how to make the API calls to retrieve the AQI data. Please note the citation and license mentioned in the notebook.   

- [part1_common_analysis.ipynb](./modules/part1_common_analysis.ipynb): This jupyter notebook provides details on the data exploration and analysis of the wildfire dataset.Please note the citation and license mentioned in the notebook.   

- [part2_extension_plan.ipynb](./modules/part2_extension_plan.ipynb): This jupyter notebook provides details of the data exploration, analysis, and some forecasting for our health concerns. We also reevaluate the models used to predict smoke from part 1. 

# Issues/ To reproduce 
 - You will need to download the GeoJSON Files.zip from [sciencebase.gov](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81) and used the USGS_Wildland_Fire_Combined_Dataset.json file. You might want to create a wild_fire_data folder to save this file if you want to follow a similar file path to this project. 
 - You might want to come up with different transformations for the variables when making smoke predictions.
 - For the wildfire data, under *wf_feature["geometry"]["rings"][0]*, some entries are a dictionary where the value is a list of lists. You might want to convert and clean these entries too. 
 - When trying to do an API call for AQI, there might be multiple FIP code for the area. 
 - Please follow the instructions to set up the API key before making an API call to retrieve AQI data. Instructions can be found [here](./example_notebooks/epa_air_quality_history_example.ipynb).
